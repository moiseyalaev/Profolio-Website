                    &emsp; Hi there! I am currently a senior at UCLA studying Mathematics of Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. My major consists of 60% applied and theoretical mathematics and 40% computer science studies. This has equipped me with a uniquely deep
                    understanding of computer science concepts such as algorithms and modeling. However, I hope to utilize the trifecta of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics towards more complicated concepts in the field of machine learning
                    and data science. One of my major life goals is to take my passion for machine learning and apply it towards something that could truly benefit the world.

                    &emsp; My girlfriend likes to describe me as someone who gets very deeply invested in various passions. She says that it would be great if only I stuck with these things long term. Of course I think she is right, but only to a degree: I believe that I
                    never truly move on from one thing, I just give it less attention to broaden my other skills. I think the distinction is critical because I could never fully learn all there is in whatever side project I am currently invested in. Recently,
                    my hobbies have included photography (all photos on my site were either edited or shot by me), gardening (I am currently growing tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and squash), mixology, making machine learning models, and cooking (For

                    <br> <br> &emsp; On the other hand, I have had hobbies that have stuck with me for most of my life. These interests are music—in the form of playing the guitar and violin—sports—mainly basketball, football, swimming, and lifting weights.
                    Almost all of these were started from a very young age and have been there to anchor me when I needed some comfort.

                    &emsp; Hi there! As you may have guessed my name is Moisey Alaev. A fun fact about me is that both my first and last name were technically misspelled when I immigrated from Uzbekistan at the age of 5. Originally, my name is Моисей Алаев which translates
                    to Mosses Alayev. I come from a traditional family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukharan_Jews">Bukharian Jews</a>. Since Uzbekistan was a satellite state of the Soviet Union, my community historically
                    faced religious persecution. Therefore, when Uzbekistan declared independence, my family—along with thousands of other Bukharian families—fled to New York City. Of course, I experienced the 'typical' transitional challenges that immigrant
                    families know all too well. However, growing up in Queens I had the unique experience of being surrounded by a myriad of different cultures and people. This allowed me to understand the importance of giving everyone a chance to tell
                    their story and share their perspective. On the flip side, it made me realize that when it comes down to it we are all just human and we all face our own set of challenges and struggles. <br> <br> &emsp; When it came time to decide
                    on a college I wanted to go somewhere that not only challenged me academically, but would also push me to be a better and more responsible person. Following that, I started UCLA in 2018 as a math of computer science major. This was
                    the second time in my life where I was really challenged to acclimate to my surroundings. Fast-forward over three years later and my girlfriend and I have been living together for over a year and recently adopted the cutest german
                    shepherd/husky mix, Luna. As it stands, I believe that I am ready to take on the next chapter in my life by starting to work full time. I believe that my life experiences have prepared me for anything that comes my way, and I am excited
                    to take it on!
