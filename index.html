                    &emsp; Hi there! Currently I work as a Software Engineer on the Automation team responsible for developing and maintaining the core security compliance product of my company. This fast-paced startup environment has grown my technical depth 
                    through collaboration with senior engineers, product managers, and customer success. In this role, I have become adept at shipping production level Ruby on Rails code, performing tech scoping, working with REST APIs, and designing 
                    scalable databases in PostgreSQL. Further, I have improved my understanding of the full tech stack using GraphQL and Typescript. These experiences have empowered me to take ownership of many customer-facing features that increased 
                    sales wins over competitors by 15% as well as enhanced NPS (customer feedback) by 10 points. While I believe I have improved exponentially as a software engineer in this role, I am still passionate about continuous improvement through 
                    working on new features, delving into personal projects, and asking for regular feedback from my talented co-workers and manager.
                    <br> <br>
                    &emsp; During my time at UCLA, I majored in Mathematics of Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. My major comprised of 60% applied/theortical mathematics and 40% computer science studies. This course of studies equipped me with a 
                    uniquely deep understanding of computer science concepts such as alogrithms, complexity, and modeling. In the future, I hope to utilize this  trifecta of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics towards more complicated concepts in 
                    the fields of machine learning and data science. With this goal in mind, I achieved a certification in Python's Tensorflow after working on several personal projects implementing a variety of deep learning architectures and data pipelines. 
                    This expertise came in handy, in particular, on my machine learning research team when I led the efforts in refactoring an open souce python module for tensor decomposion from PyTorch to Tensorflow and NumPy.

                    &emsp; My wife likes to describe me as someone who gets very deeply invested in various passions. She says that it would be great if only I stuck with these things long term. Of course I think she is right, but only to a degree: I believe that I
                    never truly move on from one thing, I just give it less attention to broaden my other skills. I think the distinction is critical because I could never fully learn all there is in whatever side project I am currently invested in. Recently,
                    my hobbies have included photography (all photos on my site were either edited or shot by me), gardening (I am currently growing tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and squash), mixology, making machine learning models, and cooking (For all

                    <br> <br> &emsp; On the other hand I have had hobbies that have stuck with me for most of my life. These interests are music—in the form of playing the guitar and violin—and sports—mainly basketball, football, swimming, and lifting
                    weights. Almost all of these were started from a very young age and have been there to anchor me when I needed some confort.

                    &emsp; Hi there! As you may have guessed my name is Moisey Alaev. A fun fact about me is that both my first and last name were technically mispelled when I immigrated from Uzbekistan at the age of 5. Originally, my name is Моисей Алаев which translates
                    to Mosses Alayev. I come from from a traditional family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukharan_Jews">Bukharian Jews</a>. Since Uzbekistan was a satellite state of the Soviet Union, my community historically
                    faced religious persecution. Therefore, when Uzbekistan delcared independence, my family-along with thousand of other Bukharian families-fled to New York City. Of course, I experienced the 'typical' transitional challenges that immigrant
                    families know all too well. However, growing up in Queens I had the unique experience of being surrounded by a myriad of different cultures and people. This allowed me to understand the importance of giving everyone a chance to tell
                    their story and share their perspective. On the flip side, it made me realize that when it comes down to it we are all just human and we all face our own set of challenges and struggles. 
                    <br> <br> 
                    &emsp; When it came time to decide on a college I wanted to go somewhere that would not only challenege me academically, but would also push me as to be a better and more responsible person. Following that, I started UCLA in 2018 as a math of 
                    computer science major. This was the second time in my life where I was really challeged to acclimate to my surroundings. Fast-foward over four years later and my wife, Emily, and I have made a home in Dallas, Texas where we welcomed our first baby, Mila, 
                    and out German Sheperad/Husky mix, Luna. I believe these life experiences have prepared me to adapt to any challenges that come my way, motivating me to coninuously improve as a father, husband, and a professional Software Engineer/ Data Scientist.
